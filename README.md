# README

High Class is an app I am developing in order to teach myself Test Driven Development (TDD) and remove my dependence on scaffolds by building a basic 'CRUD' from scratch. The app will relate to the Pathfinder role playing game (an offshoot of DND), and users will be able to create different character classes.

I will continue to update this README as I progress. 

### TECHNICAL INFORMATION:
- Rails version 5.0.2
- Ruby version 2.4.0
